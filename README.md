# TASK-6-CYBER-SECURITY-INTERSHIP-
# 🔐 Password Strength Evaluation

This project demonstrates how password complexity impacts security by evaluating a range of passwords from weak to strong. It includes an analysis of different password types, feedback from strength tests, and a summary of best practices.

---

## ✅ Objective

To test multiple passwords with varying levels of complexity and understand how structure, length, and randomness influence their resistance to attacks.

## 🧪 Tested Passwords

| Password             | Complexity Level | Summary                                 |
|----------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `ilovepizza`         | Very Weak        | Simple lowercase word, no variation     |
| `Summer2025`         | Weak             | Includes capital letter and digits      |
| `C@meraLens8`        | Moderate         | Symbol + upper/lowercase + number       |
| `Tiger#Mountain92`   | Strong           | Complex words + symbols + digits        |
| `9*Walk2TheMoon!`    | Very Strong      | Long, random phrase with full variation |

## 🧠 Analysis

Each password was created with different character traits:

- **Very Weak**: Only lowercase letters, easily guessable
- **Weak**: Common structure (word + year)
- **Moderate**: Mix of letters, symbols, and numbers
- **Strong**: Two-word phrase with symbol and digits
- **Very Strong**: Highly random, long, and complex

## 🧾 Test Results

| Password             | Estimated Crack Time  | Feedback                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `ilovepizza`         | Instant                | Too simple and common                     |
| `Summer2025`         | Few seconds            | Predictable pattern                       |
| `C@meraLens8`        | Hours                  | Moderate complexity, still guessable      |
| `Tiger#Mountain92`   | Years                  | Strong due to length and mix              |
| `9*Walk2TheMoon!`    | Millions of years      | Excellent randomness and variation        |

## 🔐 Best Practices for Strong Passwords

- Use **at least 12 characters**
- Include **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**
- **Avoid dictionary words**, names, and common patterns
- Never reuse passwords across sites
- Consider using a **password manager**

## 🛡️ Common Password Attacks

| Attack Type         | Description                                              |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Brute Force**      | Tries all possible character combinations                |
| **Dictionary Attack**| Uses known words or patterns to guess passwords          |
| **Credential Stuffing**| Uses leaked username-password combos from other sites |

---

## 📌 Conclusion

Password strength plays a critical role in protecting digital assets. Complex, unique, and longer passwords are significantly more secure. Avoiding predictable patterns and reusing credentials helps defend against most automated attacks.
